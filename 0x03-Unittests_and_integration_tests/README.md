# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

This project focuses on writing effective unit tests and integration tests for Python functions and classes. It is part of the ALX Backend specialization program.

## Description

In software development, tests help ensure code reliability and maintainability. This project emphasizes:

- Writing unit tests that validate the correctness of individual functions.
- Writing integration tests to ensure the entire system works as expected.
- Using `unittest` and `unittest.mock` for testing and mocking.
- Applying the `parameterized` library for multiple input testing.
- Mocking I/O operations such as HTTP requests.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Distinguish between unit and integration tests.
- Use `unittest` for writing test cases.
- Use `mock` to isolate tests from external systems.
- Use `parameterized.expand()` to test multiple input sets.
- Test memoized properties.

## Requirements

- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7
- PEP8 style (`pycodestyle==2.5`) is followed.
- All Python files are executable and documented.
- Use of type annotations in all functions and methods.

python3 -m unittest test_client.py
```

## Tools Used
